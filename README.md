Survo-puzzle(Interface with python and logic using ASP)
Survo-puzzle: The task is to fill an m*n table by integers 1, 2,...(m*n) so that each of these numbers appear only once. Their row and column sums are equal to integers given on the right side and the bottom of the table. Often some of integers are given readily in the table in order to guarantee uniqueness of the solution.
